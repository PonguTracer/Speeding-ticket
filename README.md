# 24.8 LAB: Speeding ticket
Write a program that is given two integers representing a speed limit and driving speed in miles per hour (mph) and outputs the traffic ticket amount.

Driving 10 mph under the speed limit (or slower) receives a $50 ticket. Driving 6 - 20 mph over the speed limit receives a $75 ticket. Driving 21 - 40 mph over the speed limit receives a $150 ticket. Driving faster than 40 mph over the speed limit receives a $300 ticket. Otherwise, no ticket is received.
